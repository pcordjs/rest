# Contributing to @pcordjs/rest

Thanks for taking the time to help this project improve! All contributions are
helpful and welcome.

## I have a question!

If you just have a question about the library or need help, the best way you can
get support is by creating a post in the [Q&A Discussions
category](https://github.com/pcordjs/rest/discussions/categories/q-a).

## Ways to contribute

### Reporting a problem

If something is not working as expected, you can use the repository's
[Issues][issues-page] page to report it. Before
creating a bug report, use the search bar to make sure that what you're
experiencing isn't already a known issue.

#### If you find an issue that describes the same problem

If the issue you found is *closed*, it's fine to make a new one, but make sure
to **link the one you found** under the **Additional information** header.

However, if the issue you found is *open*, the best way to help is by leaving a
comment on it, describing your experience.

#### Reporting a typo

If the problem you're reporting is a typo or a just a simple mistake, you may
want to use the **Small issue** template instead, in the following step.

#### Writing and submitting your report

When creating your report, you should use the **Bug report** issue template to
be provided with a list of questions that will help describe the problem you are
having.

Additionally, try to do the following:

- Give the issue a **clear and concise** title.
- Fill out **as many of the template's headers as possible**.
- Provide a **code sample** to help readers reproduce the issue.
- Provide your Node.js version, and operating system.
- Attach **screenshots or GIFs** to help display the problem.
- Explain **when the problem started happening**. Was it after a recent update?
  Or has it always been happening?

### Suggesting features

First of all, thanks for wanting to share your idea! Feature requests help this
project grow.

Before submitting your suggestion, remember to consider the following:

- Your idea may have already been discussed. Use the
  [Issues][issues-page] search bar to see if there
  are any similar suggestions.
- Your idea should be within the project's scope. The goal of this project is to
  provide a flexible, low-level HTTPS client for Discord's REST API.

#### If you find an issue that suggests your idea

If the issue is *open,* send it a :+1: emoji! If it's closed, it's possible it
has already been implemented or was denied.

#### Writing and submitting your suggestion

When creating your report, you should use the **Feature request** issue template to
be provided with a list of questions that will help describe the suggestion you are submitting.

Additionally, try to do the following:

- Give the issue a **clear and concise** title.
- Fill out **as many of the template's headers as possible**.
- Provide **code samples, screenshots, or GIFs** to help readers understand what you're saying.
- Consider **how the suggestion would be implemented**. Try to think of at least 2
  different ways!
